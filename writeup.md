## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

Negative appears to be the most common sentiment observed, with 30 negative sentiments, 5 neutral, and 15 positive.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

I don't believe the labels are very reliable. The reliability of OpenAI's sentiment labels appears to be inconsistent, especially for ambiguous or off-topic reviews like those that could be considered "irrelevant." The model accurately classifies clear sentiments but missed the "irrelevant" category in the chart, classifying each of the 50 reviews as "positive", "negative", or "neutral" and no irrelevant reviews classified. This data suggests it may not handle such reviews well. Model hallucinations where the AI generates incorrect labels, can introduce risks and issues by misclassifying reviews, which skews the analysis and reduces its accuracy.

## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

The most common sentiment appears to be negative, with the data showing 30 negative reviews. Thus, I would recommend the Coconut Water producer reassess aspects of the product, such as taste, packaging, or pricing, in which data can be gathered from bigger review samples. Addressing customer concerns and improving areas highlighted in reviews could help create more positive sentiments. Focusing on product improvements and customer feedback would likely lead to higher satisfaction and stronger market positioning.
